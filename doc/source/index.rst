Mr. Crowbar
===========

Wait, what?!
------------

Mr. Crowbar is a Django-esque model framework that makes it super easy to work with proprietary binary formats while reverse engineering. 

File formats are described with Python classes that allow ORM-like free modification of structures and properties, which in turn can be validated and converted back to the binary equivalent at any time.

The eventual goal is to provide a library for storing file format information that retains the readability of a text file, while providing instant read/write support for almost no cost.





But why?!?
----------

What is the best way to engage people with computer science?

Lots of people are trying their best to answer this question. Hell, with CS one of the few bright points left in an otherwise bleak economic picture for kids entering the workforce, politicians with no experience are tripping over themselves to endorse learn-to-code initiatives without questioning their efficacy. 

You don't need me to tell you this, but rote learning isn't the same as engaging!

Let's focus on the example of modding games. Modding games is great hacking experience; whether it's making custom levels, swapping out character sprites for something new, or even translating all of the text and artwork into a new language. You get the advantage of building upon a solid foundation of assets and code, with a pre-existing audience of fans. Most importantly, you will gain knowledge of how things are done in the real world and why; an education you can't get from following examples or reading StackOverflow.


The era of DIY game modding predates the recent mainstreaming of open source. Visit gbatemp.net or romhacking.net and you'll find hundreds of hand-rolled tools from years past; none of them actively maintained, nearly all of them without source code.


What's with the name?
---------------------

No reason for the name, other than "crowbar" was taken. Despite the honorific the prybar with the googly eyes is, like countless corporate mascots before it, a magical pan-sexual non-threatening spokesthing. Also there's an unfortunate Redmond connotation to any software that begins with the letters "ms".
